Hack to compile .so libs with gradle
====================================



See: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/adt-dev/so/adt-dev/nQobKd2Gl_8/Z5yWAvCh4h4J

Basic rundown:
- compress the 'lib' dir (so that the lib is the root in the new zip)
- rename new zip to "whatever.jar"
- move to app libs with other jars to get included with the build
